# jisho-grabber-firefox
A Firefox add-on version of my other library, jisho-grabber. This add-on allows the user to
select a definition within the Jisho webpage directly.

*This program and its author are not affiliated with the main Anki project or Jisho.org in any*
*way.*

## What it does

- Adds two context menu (left-click menu) items: one for searching highlighted text on Jisho.org,
  and another for selecting a definition of a word on Jisho.org and adding it to a JSON.
- Upon click, it opens a new webpage on jisho.org searching the highlighted text.
